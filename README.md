# BuyMeACoffee Project

This project is a full-stack Dapp that allows users to send money to the deployer that is stored within the smart contract and can be withdrawn by the deployer. It allows the user to send their name and a message that will be displayed once the transaction is complete.

This project is Week Two of Alchemy's Road To Web3 series which is a self-paced web3 developer program to help new blockchain devs go from beginner to advanced.

## Usage

Before starting, ensure you are connected to Goerli's test network and that you have ETH on the network. Start by clicking "Connect your wallet" and follow metamask's steps to confirm wallet connection. Once the wallet is connected, you can type your name and a message to be displayed on the page. Finally, click on "Send 1 coffee for 0.001ETH" and confirm on metamask. Wait for the transaction to complete and watch your name and message appear at the bottom!
